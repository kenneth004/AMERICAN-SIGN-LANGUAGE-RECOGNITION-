# AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION

# Project Description
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

In this project, I trained a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, I trained the network and tested its performance.

The recommended prerequisites for this project are Deep Learning in Python and Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Processing.
